## OVERVIEW REPORT
Here is how I worked on the Assignment;
First of all I downloaded Oracle Database 23ai and installed it
After installation I opened cmd as Administrator and then used the sqlplus / as sysdba to connect to the database

After completing that I explored the oracle sql developer and connected it to the oracle database. I created a pluggable database basing on the instructions in the assignment

While working on task three I failed to configure Oracle Enterprise Manager but am still looking for other options to find out how I can work on it
